# Defect-Formation-Calculation

This package is a integrated Defect Formation energy package, which contains generating tetrahedral interstitial sites and  octahedral interstitial sites, submitting `VASP` calculation job and withdraw necessary data to calculate defect formation energy.


## Generate defect structures

There are three kinds of defect system you can generate, vacancy defect, purity defect and interstitial defect. All these can be generated by [defect_maker](./defect_maker.py), and the generated structures in VASP format will be stored in a directory named by its attributes.
