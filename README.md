## 0. Installment
Firstly, you should make a directory for those scripts and add its path to your `.bashrc`. I divide these scripts into three directories so that you can easily know the usage of each scripts, and you can put them all into a directory in order to conveniently use them. For example, I make the `scripts` directory under my $HOME directory, so I can use the below command to add this directory to $PATH, and `source` your `.bashrc` to make it work.

```shell
echo export PATH="$PATH:/home/hecc/scripts" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 1. Generate defect structures

There are three kinds of defect system you can generate, vacancy defect, purity defect and interstitial defect. All these can be generated by [defectmaker.py](./defect_maker.py), and the generated structures in VASP format will be stored in a directory named by its attributes.<br >
Here we supply the command `pyvasp.py` to generate the defect POSCAR you want.

__Noted that, if you get `permission denied` error, please use `chmod u+x pyvasp.py` to give the execute right to the file. and first, you should load sagar to load some necessary package__

```shell
module load sagar #load the necesary package
pyvasp.py --help # you can get some short help from this command
pyvasp.py main --help # get the help of a specific command  
```


Follow the below example, the parameter `-i` means the the atom which will dopped into the system, the parameter `-o` means the atom which will be removed.

__Noted that, if you get `permission denied`, please use `chmod u+x pyvasp.py` to give the execute right to the file__

```shell
pyvasp.py get_purity --help # get some help
# generate purity defect poscar including vacancy defect
# this means generate a Si-vacancy defect
pyvasp.py get_purity_poscar supcell.vasp -i Vacc -o Si
# generate H tetrahedral sites defect
pyvasp.py get_tetrahedral POSCAR -i H
```


## 2. submit your common calculation jobs

First, we supply some shell scripts to generate those input file for VASP calculation, they are [potcar.sh](./common_calculation_shell/potcar.sh), [incar.sh](./common_calculation_shell/incar.sh), [kpoints.sh](./common_calculation_shell/kpoints.sh). Below I will simply introduce the usage of these scripts.

__These scripts will not work if correspondent files exist, for example, incar.sh will not work if an INCAR file exists in your current directory__

### 2.1 potcar.sh
There are two parameters you can input. The first parameter is the type of potcar

* 1 is correspondent to `PAW_PBE`
* 2 is correspondent to `PAW_LDA`
* 3 is correspondent to `PAW_PW91`
* 4 is correspondent to `USPP_LDA`
* 5 is correspondent to `USPP_PW91`

The defaul of first parameter is 1, and if it can uncompress `POTCAR.Z` file to `POTCAR`.<br >
The second parameter is the type of atom potcar, maybe the same atom has some different type of potcar, for example, Mg atom has `Mg, Mg_GW, Mg_pv, Mg_pv_GW, Mg_sv, Mg_sv_GW` potcar, so you can specify one of them to get specific POTCAR, the default of this parameter is the atom itself.
```shell
potcar.sh 2 # this will generate the POTCAR based on your PSOCAR from  PAW_LDA directory
potcar.sh 1 Mg_pv # noted that 1 can be omited
```

### 2.2 incar.sh
This script is used to generate INCAR for your system, and it supposes that the POTCAR has been in your directory, because `ENCUT` should be set based on the `ENMAX` of your POTCAR.

### 2.3 kpoints.sh
This script is used to generate KPOINTS, the usage is:
```shell
kpoint.sh 40 # this will generate KPOINTS mesh 40/a 40/b 40/c
kpoint.sh band # this will genrate k-path based on `aflow`
```

### 2.4 some test-parameters scripts

* [kp_test.sh](./parameter_test_shell/kp_test.sh) can test what kinds of KPOINTS you should use <br >
* [encut_test.sh](./parameter_test_shell/encut_test.sh) can help you test what `ENCUT` is best suitable for your calculations.<br >
* [latt_const_test.sh](./parameter_test_shell/latt_const_test.sh) can test which lattice constant is best for the system you are calculating.
### 2.5 some integrated scripts

Here, we supply some integrated shell scripts to calculate the jobs you need.<br />
* [stru_relax.sh](./common_calculation_shell/stru_relax.sh) (structure relax, ISIF=3)<br />
* [stru_optimization.sh](./common_calculation_shell/stru_optimization.sh) (structure optimization, ISIF=2)<br />
* [stru_scf.sh](./common_calculation_shell/stru_scf.sh) (structure self consistent field calculation)<br />
* [stru_band.sh](./common_calculation_shell/stru_band.sh) (band calculation)<br />
* [stru_dos.sh](./common_calculation_shell/stru_dos.sh) (density of states calculation)<br />
* [job.sh](./common_calculation_shell/job.sh) (submit your job)


Here, almost all `*.sh` file will automatic make a new directory for its calculation, and will arrange in the top directory in parallel except for `stru_relax.sh` and `stru_optimization.sh`, because we need CONTCAR from relax or optimization when doing self-consisten-field calculation, if we make a single directory for relax and optimization, then you should specify the path of CONTCAR(whether under relax or optimization), so here we do not make a single directory for relax and optimization.

And each file can be executed respectively with some necessary files. Below I list the necessary files each script need to read in the current directory.
 * `stru_relax`, `stru_optimization` need POSCAR
 * `stru_scf` needs CONTCAR
 * `stru_dos`, `stru_band` need scf/CHG scf/CHGCAR

Below is an example.

```





We also supply some scripts to generate the input files needed in `VASP` Calculation, such as `INCAR`, `KPOINTS`, `POTCAR`, you can also use these  scripts to generate them. So in general, you can just begin your job from a `POSCAR` and a `job.sh`.

## 3. Get some calculation value via `pyvasp`

Here we supply a command interface to get the value you want.

__Noted that, if you get `permission denied`, please use `chmod u+x pyvasp.py` to give the execute right to the file__

### 3.1 pyvasp-help
```shell
module load sagar #load the necesary package
pyvasp.py --help # you can get some short help from this command
pyvasp.py main --help # get the help of a specific command  
```

### 3.2 pyvasp-`main`
This command is used to get some common value of your calculation system. For instance, gap, fermi energy, electrons number and so on.
The last parameter is the directory path of your calculation system, make sure it is right or you will get wrong answer.
```shell
pyvasp.py main -a gap . # this can read the gap and vbm, cbm
pyvasp.py main -a fermi . # this can read the fermi energy
pyvasp.py main -a energy . # this can read the total energy
pyvasp.py main -a ele . # this can read the electrons in your OUTCAR
pyvasp.py main -a ele-free . # this can get electrons number of  the defect-free system
pyvasp.py main -a image image_corr/ # this can get Ewald energy of your system, using `pyvasp.py main -a ewald image_corr` can also get the same result.
```

### 3.3 pyvasp-`cell`
This command is used to extend your cell and generate a supcell.vasp
```shell
pyvasp cell -v 2 2 2 POSCAR
# extend your POSCAR to 2*2*2 supercell
```

### 3.4 pyvasp-`get_purity`
This command is used to get the purity structures , such Si-vacancy, Ga purity in In2O3 system, but noted that each time only one purity atom will be dopped into the system.
```shell
pyvasp get_purity -i Vacc -o Si Si-POSCAR # generate a vacancy
pyvasp get_purity -i Ga -o In In2O3-POSCAR #genrate a Ga defect
```

### 3.5 pyvasp-`get_tetrahedral`
This command is used to get the tetrahedral interstitial sites, for example, in YFe2 system, H atom can be inserted into the tetrahedral sites.

```shell
pyvasp get_tetrahedral -i H YFe2-POSCAR
```

### 3.6 pyvasp-`get_PA`
This command can get the electrostatic of your defect system and no defect system of the farther atom from defect atom
```shell
pyvasp.py get_PA defect_free charge_state_1
```

### 3.7 pyvasp-`symmetry`
This command can get some symmetry message of your POSCAR.

```shell
pyvasp symmetry -a spacegroup POSCAR # get space group
pyvasp symmetry -a equivalent POSCAR # get equivalent atoms
pyvasp symmetry -a primitive POSCAR # generate primitive cell POSCAR
```


## 4. Examples
Here I will give some examples to demonstrate how this package works
### 4.0 band-dos calculation
Prepare your POSCAR in your work directory, if you want to use the default setting, you can just execute the command like `stru_relax.sh` to calculate your system for which can generate `INCAR, KPOINTS, POTCAR` automatic.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#NOTE the -l flag!
#SBATCH -J job-name
#SBATCH -p super_q  -N 1 -n 12
#SBATCH -t 10-0:0:0
# NOTE Each small node has 12 cores
#
export NSLOTS=$SLURM_NPROCS
module load vasp/5.4.4-impi-mkl
stru_relax.sh
stru_scf.sh
stru_band.sh
stru_dos.sh
```
The initial files can only be `POSCAR` and `job.sh`

```
[hecc@cmp Si]$ ll

-rwxrw-r-- 1 hecc hecc 234 Apr  4 15:19 job.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hecc hecc 345 Apr  4 15:19 POSCAR
```

then you can sbath your job and after calculation, you will get the below files.

```

-rw-rw-r-- 1 hecc hecc    283 Apr  4 15:49 XDATCAR

```

Here, the main directory contains relax-results or optimization-results, the band, dos, scf will respectively contain correspondent files.


### 4.1 Si-vacancy-defect
First, you should supply the POSCAR of Si, and execute
```bash
# generate Si-vacancy structures
pyvasp.py get_purity -i Vacc -o Si POSCAR
```
to generate purity `POSCAR`, and then submit your job. Below is an example job file.
```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
# NOTE the -l flag!
#
#SBATCH -J Si
# Default in slurm
# Request 5 hours run time
#SBATCH -t 4-5:0:0
#
#SBATCH -p super_q -N 1 -n 12
# NOTE Each small node has 12 cores
#
module load vasp/5.4.4-impi-mkl
# add your job logical here!!!

# this is the defect directory
defect_folder=Si-Vacc-defect

export NSLOTS=$SLURM_NPROCS
mkdir supercell
cp POSCAR supercell/
cd supercell
stru_relax.sh
stru_scf.sh
cd ..
get_ground_defect_stru.sh $defect_folder
cd $defect_folder
for q in  -2 -1 0 1 2
do
  charge_state_cal.sh $q
done
cd ..
image_corr_cal.sh
```

You can get a standard hierarchy of files if you do not encounter any accident problems after all calculations have been completed. Below is an example, and your files should also be like this.

```
[hecc@cmp ~]$ tree Si/ -d
Si/
├── image_corr
├── Si-Vacc-defect
│   ├── charge_state_0
│   │   └── scf
│   ├── charge_state_1
│   │   └── scf
│   ├── charge_state_-1
│   │   └── scf
│   ├── charge_state_2
│   │   └── scf
│   ├── charge_state_-2
│   │   └── scf
│   └── POSCAR-Si-Vacc-defect_id0.vasp-dir
└── supercell
    └── scf
```

you can execute `defect_formation_energy.py`
to plot the figure.
```bash
# the first parameter is the path of  main directory
# the second parameter is the path of your defect directory
defect_formation_energy.py Si  Si/Si-Vacc-defect
```
Also, we will write a log file named `${defect_folder}_log.txt` to record some necessary message in your calculation process.



### 4.2 In2O3
